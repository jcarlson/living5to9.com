######### IDEAS TO PONDER ########

> Normalize photo metadata to a discrete table?
> Don't store metadata in the database unless necessary?



####### PATHS TO IMPLEMENT #######

# Photo viewer path
/photos/:id(-:slug)

# Physical photo paths
/photos/:id/:filename.:format
/photos/:id/:version/:filename.:format

# Virtual photo paths                           <-- not a requirement at this time, but someday
/photos/:id/:width.:height.:filename.:format    <-- serve dynamically resized images which are then cached to filesystem
/photos/:id/:version/:filename.:format

# Photo-of-the-day paths
# Photos must have been assigned a "date" to qualify for this view
/dailies/:year/:month                           <-- lightbox-style viewer
/dailies/:year/:month/:day                      <-- similar to /photos/:id, but with links to next and prev day
