ADD: Calendar view of released photos

ADD: Standard blog, with formatting and syntax highlighting, for code posts
ADD: Proper homepage with "recent posts"
ADD: "Thing of the Day", which could be all the old CDs I've found or some cool website I've stumbled upon
ADD: Autocomplete tag values
ADD: Syntax highlighting in Markdown with Nokogiri and Albino (see Railscast #272), or google code syntax highlighter?
ADD: Support Dragonfly images in Markdown with a custom processor or Nokogiri
ADD: Support multiple flavors of Posts: http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats#Supported_Formats
BUG: Post publish_at is tracked in UTC?
REM: Draper is not that effective; should probably remove it; regular old model+helper is probably good enough
TODO: Store slugs with '/' built in so <%= link_to post.title, post.slug %> works
TODO: Improve content truncation, or just add a 'synopsis' field

NOW: Polish front-end UI to launch-ready state

NEXT: Probably need to look at moving from Dreamhost to Heroku, given recurring problems with deployment...

THEN: WYSIWYG editor like Mercury or Aloha

LATER: TextMate supports XML-RPC blog writing? Egads! Can Rails support this?
LATER: Look again at Typo and see what it offers
