  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file

  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Large format version, suitable for the standard photo viewer page
  version :large do

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
